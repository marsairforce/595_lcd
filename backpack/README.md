* Where the price of the board is per board. OSH Park requires you order in quantities of 3 boards, and their price is in USD, so converting and adjusting for CDN here.

So the cost to build one backpack module is about $7 CDN plus taxes. One could do better ordering bulk quantities of these components, or substituting for things on hand in your junk bin.
